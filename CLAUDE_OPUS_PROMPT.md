# Claude Opus CSS Debugging Prompt

## Context
I have a React + Vite application with CSS specificity conflicts preventing glass morphism styling from appearing on a ChatInterface component. The background remains transparent despite multiple override attempts.

## Your Task
Please analyze the attached CSS styling package and provide **step-by-step fixes** in a copy-paste format. I need you to:

1. **Diagnose the root cause** of why the glass morphism background isn't appearing
2. **Recommend the best CSS architecture** for this project (Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, Styled Components, etc.)
3. **Provide sequential fixes** that I can copy-paste one at a time
4. **Wait for my confirmation** that each step worked before proceeding to the next
5. **Include verification steps** so I can confirm each fix is working

## Current Situation
- Framework: React + Vite with traditional CSS imports
- Problem: ChatInterface panel background remains transparent
- Goal: Apply glass morphism styling matching the working CaptureAssistant component
- Previous attempts: Removed global panel wrapper, added high-specificity selectors with !important
- **Open to better CSS architecture:** Currently using traditional CSS but willing to migrate to modern solutions (Tailwind, CSS Modules, Styled Components, etc.)

## Required Format for Your Response

Please structure your response exactly like this:

---

## **Root Cause Analysis**

## **Debugging Commands**
If any step doesn't work, run these commands to gather more info:

```bash
# Command 1
[specific debugging command]

# Command 2  
[another debugging command]
```

## Design System Requirements
- **Glass Morphism Target:** `background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05)` with `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)`
- **Working Reference:** CaptureAssistant component (already functioning correctly)
- **Credence Branding:** Red primary (#C41E3A), Blue gradients (#667eea → #764ba2)

## Files Involved
Based on the analysis package, the key files are:
- `client/src/App.css` (global styles)
- `client/src/components/ChatInterface.css` (component styles)
- `client/src/components/ChatInterface.tsx` (component structure)
- `client/src/App.tsx` (layout structure)

## Constraints
- Must maintain existing functionality
- Should not break other components
- **Prefer modern CSS solutions** if they solve the architectural problems
- Open to framework migration if benefits outweigh setup time
- Must work with React + Vite setup
- **Priority:** Long-term maintainability over quick fixes

---

**Please start with your Root Cause Analysis, then provide your CSS Architecture Recommendation, and finally provide only Step 1 initially. I will confirm each step works before you provide the next one.**

**Key Questions to Address:**
1. What's the best CSS framework for a React + Vite project with glass morphism design?
2. Should we fix the current traditional CSS setup or migrate to something better?
3. What are the pros/cons of each approach for long-term maintenance?
