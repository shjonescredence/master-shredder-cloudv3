# Backend Scaffold

This is a basic Express.js backend for your project.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Visit [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) to test the API.

## Project Structure
- `index.js`: Main server file
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: Copilot custom instructions

## Next Steps
- Add more routes in `index.js` or split into route/controller files as needed.
